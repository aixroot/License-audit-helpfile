Dealing with Software License audits
Before the audit
If you use proprietary software make sure you have SAM, ITAM, AM.
If you work for a big company or a government you may be audited.
Software audits are just like lie detector tests: 
You will always fail and be asked to confess your software sins and pay up. 

How software companies try to get in. They say:
1.	We offer a License /capacity optimization review (!) = not audit
2.	Contract: please cooperate with us because of an audit clause in the license.
3.	External ‘independent’ auditors (big 4$) (you can ask how they get paid: perverse effect)
4.	BSA Business Software Alliance (Microsoft) No more business,   An alliance with a powerful party is never safe. You have no relation with BSA, you are a scalp. 
If they get legal on you, so be it. They need to get a court order to enter the premises.

If you get a “We would like to Audit letter” that is anywhere between approaches 1 till 4 this needs to be circulated to the appropriate internal stakeholders:
1.	consult your legal department and let them read the fine license agreement, and counter any legalese (cancel the license)
2.	Let your IT department and audit department find the latest SAM audit results.
3.	Use the results to close the process at this point. 
4.	If they persist , tell them the audit would be very cumbersome and not welcome try to deter this – it’s a costly exercise for both parties and they may agree not to move forward 
5.	If a full audit goes ahead ensure the process includes a very formal set of meetings
a.	Write an audit agreement document (see below)
b.	External auditors should audit according to ISAE 3000, not a review.
c.	internal software management team, to agree on the metrics and how the amount of licenses should be calculated.
d.	CFO or CIO should be in charge of the audit.
e.	Risk analysis. And staff the team accordingly. 
f.	Engagement by senior internal audit manager. 
g.	Make sure you agree on the audit scope and schedule.
h.	Scope: specific product in a specific time frame. ( ask for the sales information: what did we buy from you)
i.	Stipulate that the data and results are not used for any other purpose. (ask for guarantees :-)

Audited organization should negotiate and enter into a non-disclosure agreement with the applicable third party to ensure that any proprietary information revealed to the third party during or in connection with the audit process is kept strictly confidential.


*Before the audit write an audit agreement document
1.	Agree on a time period
2.	Agree data types: log data, server 
3.	Instance, vm, container cloud, 
4.	Claim copyrights on all data and deployment information.
5.	No tools in your network, audit during office hours (or not ;-)
6.	Do not fill in the forms of the auditor. (list all servers real and virtual)
7.	Have all mail and post with you translated in your own language.
8.	Ask for a “certificate of good conduct” for the each of the auditing staff. 
9.	Don’t let them run around, Never unsupervised, dedicated guard. Give them a room with a coffee thermos. (or not)
10.	Agree a SPOC! (for all subsidiaries) 
11.	a list of agreed evidence: system output (no interviews or own observation by the auditor) 
12.	Records should never leave the premises. (Perverse effects: if the seller knows your software / hardware setup he is better equipped to quote in a tender process)
13.	You don’t have to be nice. (Data centers have a shredder for smartphones :-)
14.	Do not automatically agree with suggested deadlines (make sure they are achievable)
15.	The auditor should, of course, have the right to disclose the audit results (not the data) to their client; however, it is important that the audited organization reserve its right to review and comment on the audit findings before they are presented to the software vendor


The concept audit report should contain:
1.	Product identification;
2.	Product name;
3.	How it was calculated and the actual metric;
4.	Overzicht rechten van elk product van; 
5.	Broninformatie waarop het overzicht van het deployment van elk product is gebaseerd (bijvoorbeeld Server type, model, naam, processors, cores);
6.	Include Settlement in audit agreement
7.	Cost of audit, second opinion.
8.	Overpay, redistribute to other departments, 
9.	No more reviews for a while. 

Conduct a Lessons learned review 
1.	Recalculate your TCO
2.	Get your SAM in order (risk mitigation)
3.	Look for an better license then the one you use currently  (risk avoidance)
4.	Open source alternative
